New packages added to the [minotaur archive](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/minotaur-archive) are always published in version `1.0.0`. This means that nay and all changes made to the package during the review process, should only bump the `Minor` or `Patch` version of the package.

PR checklist:

- [ ] The package description has been updated to the title of the paper.
- [ ] This package contains a BibTex file.
 - If this package already exists in the [community archive](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/community-archive):
   - [ ] The information from the community archive was used to fill-in empty janno fields (if applicable).
   - [ ] The commands used for the fill-in and any tool versions are kept track of in the README file.
   - [ ] The BibTex key used for the citation is _identical_ to that in the corresponding package in the community archive.
   - [ ] The DOI in the BibTex file is _identical_ to the one used in the corresponding package in the comunity archive.
 - If the janno information was collected manually:
   - [ ] Add any additional contributors to `POSEIDON.yml`
- [ ] Any scripts/commands used to prepare the pacakge are kept track of in the README file.
- [ ] `Country` information is also present in the `Country_ISO` column.
- [ ] Any columns in the janno that are entirely missing or `n/a` should be removed from the janno.
